# Angular-Workout
<br>
This app is culmination of my angular knowlegde and it will be updated quite often.
<br>
What does it do?
<br>
It let user create his own library of exercises and workouts.
At the moment it's without backend. So it's just a preview of what that app can do.
I'm planning to connect it to firebase - starting with user authetication.
